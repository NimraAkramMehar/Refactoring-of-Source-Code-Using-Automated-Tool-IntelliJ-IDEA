# Refactoring of Source Code Using Automated Tool (IntelliJ IDEA)
Refactoring is the process of altering a software system in such a way that it doesnâ€™t change the internal behavior of the code and improve its quality. Continuous refactoring of the source code is essential to maintain its quality and to deal with technical debt. Refactoring can be more efficient with the help of automated tools using agile techniques.In this research, we will discuss code refactoring by automated refactoring tool IntelliJ IDEA through agile technique i.e., Pair Programming.

# IntelliJ IDEA:
IntelliJ IDEA is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for JVM languages designed to maximize developer productivity. It does the routine and repetitive tasks for you by providing clever code completion, static code analysis, and refactorings, and lets you focus on the bright side of software development, making it not only productive but also an enjoyable experience. You can download IntelliJ IDEA from here: (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)

**Know about features of IntelliJ IDEA:** (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/) 

## Pair Programming with IntelliJ IDEA:
We opt pair programming technique via IntelliJ IDEA. Two or more than two programmers work together via IntelliJ IDEA which is used for pair programming by using Code With Me plugin. In this case you share your IDE with a single participant and either use the Full sync mode, or follow each other and collaborate on different parts of code. Unlike classic pair-programming where developers share a single screen and a keyboard, you can work independently and achieve the goal faster.

## Refactoring with IntelliJ IDEA:
The three ways of refactoring that we can do by using IntelliJ IDEA.
- Extracting and Inlining
- Change Signature
- Renaming

We will perform the method extraction and Inlining by using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Source Code to Refactor:
You can use any source code written in JVM languages to refactor. In this case I use "Account.Java" code. **How I refactor this source code?** 
I published a blog where you can follow for further information.

The Account code is refactored by using IntelliJ IDEA. It is one of the most powerful refactoring tools. The tasks like replacing loops or control statements, long methods, the elimination of duplicate code, and information abstraction can be done by using this tool. It also suggests suitable changes that help us to avoid errors in code, but it also has some limitations.
